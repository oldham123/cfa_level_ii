# Reading 19: Evaluating Quality of Financial Reports

- High quality reporting is that which provides *decision-useful* information
  - This information should be accurate as well as relevant
- High-quality earnings are sustainable, and satisfy the required return
  - Earnings cannot be high-quality without the reporting also being high-quality

## Potential Problems that Affect the Quality of Financial Reports

- Problems can result from:
  - Measurement and timing issues
  - Classification issues
- Additionally, biased accounting can compromise reporting quality
- GAAP compliance is a necessary but not sufficient condition for high-quality reporting

## Quantitative Models

- *The Beneish Model* is used to estimate the probability of earnings manipulation
  - It is based on eight key variables
    - Days Sales in Receivables
    - Gross Margin Index
    - Asset Quality Index &rarr; An indicator of excessive capitalisation of expenses
    - Sales Growth Index &rarr; A sales growth index of more than 1 implies that sales growth is positive
    - Depreciation Index &rarr; A depreciation index of less than 1 indicates depreciation is speeding up
    - Sales, General, and Administrative Expenses Index
    - Leverage Index
    - Total Accruals to Total Assets Index
  - As managers have become aware of the variables it has become possible to "game" the model
    - This is supported by a decline in the predictive power of the model

## High-Quality Earnings

- High-quality earnings are:
  - *Sustainable* &rarr; Likely to reoccur, with a low proportion of one-off items
  - *Adequate* &rarr; Sufficient to cover the company's cost of capital
- There are two major sources of earnings manipulation:
  - Revenue recognition
  - Expense recognition

## Mean Reversion in Earnings

- *Mean reversion* %rarr; The tendency to revert to normal levels over time
  - Implies very high earnings are not sustainable
  - Mean reversion is quicker for accruals-based earnings
  - High earnings in the short run can cause a long-run trend of decreasing earnings as mean reversion takes place

## Evaluating the Earnings Quality of a Company

- Elements to check for when evaluating cash flows:
  - Unusual items
  - Excessive outflows due to aggressive revenue recognition
  - Provisions for/reversals of restructuring changes
- High quality for a balance sheet is evidenced by:
  - Completeness
    - Compromised by off-balance sheet liabilities such as operating leases
  - Unbiased measurement
    - Items allowing discretion such as pension obligations and goodwill can involve bias
    - When evaluating choices / accounting assumptions made by management, refer to the choices of competitors to see if they are typical of the sector
  - Clarity
  - Reconciling reported results with cash flows is a powerful way of checking whether use of management discretion is being used to, for example, accelerate revenue recognition

  ## Examples of Potential Manipulation of Financial Results

  - Overstating profitabiltiy:
    - A lessor's use of a sales-type finance lease results in recognition of gross profit at lease inception
    - Selecting LIFO or FIFO in order to reduce COGS (and therefore increase net income)
    - LIFO liquidation results in decelerated inventory purchases, allowing older, lower costs to be used to calculate COGS, increasing net income
    - Recognising revenue before earned and payment is assured
    - May also entail accelerated recognition of expenses (e.g. early revenue recognition entails early COGS recognition)
    - Overstating inventory is another method of reducing COGS and increasing net income
    - Bill-and-hold transactions result in the recognition of revenue for the sale of inventory that is still in the firm's possession, without altering cash flows
  - Understating profitability
    - Classifying non-operating expenses as operating
    - Sending losses to the income statement, and gains to OCI

    ## Cash Basis and Accrual Basis of accounting

    - *Cash Basis*
      - Revenues are recognised when cash is collected
      - Expenses are recognised when cash is paid
      - This allows revenues and expenses to occur in different periods to when the cash flows occur (e.g. cash is paid for equipment immediately, but revenues are generated over time)
    - *Accrual Basis*
      - Revenues are recognised when earned
      - Expenses are recognised when incurred
      - In the example of the equipment, the cost goes to the income statement over the asset's life, matching the revenues generated
    - The cash basis of accounting provides more timely and relevant information about future cash flows
    - The accrual basis of acocunting requires more use of discretion
