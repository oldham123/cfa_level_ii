2. Collect data
3. Process data
4. Analyse data
5. Develop and communicate conclusions
6. Follow up

## Integration of FSA Techniques

1. Use the extended DuPont equation to examine the sources of earnings and performance
2. Remove equity income from associates and the investment account to eliminate any bias
3. Examine the compostiion of the balance sheet over time
4. Determine if the capital structure can support future obligations
5. Identify the contributions of each segment
6. Adjust the balance sheet for off-balance sheet activity
7. Be aware of the impact of proposed changes to accounting standards
8. Confirm earnings by comparing with cash flows
9. Eliminate the pro-rata market value of investments in associates to determine the standalone market value of the firm

## Major Differences Between IFRS and GAAP Treatment

- *Passive investments*
  - IFRS &rarr; Unrealised gains/losses on available-for-sale debt securities due to FX movements go to the income statement
  - GAAP &rarr; All unrealised gains/losses on available-for-sale securities go to OCI
- *Reclassification of passive investments*
  - IFRS &rarr; Reclassification into and out of fair value through profit or loss is restricted
  - GAAP &rarr; No restriction 
- *Impairment losses on passive investments*
  - IFRS &rarr; Reversal allowed it attributed to a specific event
  - GAAP &rarr; No reversal allowed
- *Investment in associates*
  - IFRS &rarr; Fair value accounting only allowed for VC, mutual funds, and similar entities
  - GAAP &rarr; Fair value accounting allowed for all
- *Acquisition method - Goodwill computation*
  - IFRS &rarr; Partial goodwill allowed
  - GAAP &rarr; Partial goodwill not allowed
- *Goodwill impairment*
  - IFRS &rarr; 1-step process
  - GAAP &rarr; 2-step process
- *Acquisition method - recognition of contingent assets*
  - IFRS &rarr; Not allowed
  - GAAP &rarr; Allowed
- *Allocation of pension cost to P\&L vs. OCI*
  - IFRS &rarr; Prior service cost expensed, discount rate $=$ required return, remeasurements go to OCI and don't amortise
  - GAAP &rarr; Prior service cost goes to OCI and amortises, actuarial gains/losses go to OCI and amortise using the corridor approach
- *Subsidiaries in hyperinflationary economies*
- IFRS &rarr; Restate local currency statements for inflation, then convert at current rate
- GAAP &rarr; Use the temporal method

## Lease Adjustment

- Some firms may attempt to manipulate results by taking advantage of off-balance sheet financing
  - An example of this would be the use of an operating lease instead of a finance lease
  - An operating lease treats the entire lease payment as an operating expense
  - Adjusting for an operating lease involves the following
    - Add the rental payment back to EBIT
    - Subtract the implied depreciation expense from operating profit
    - Add the implied interest expense to reported interest
  - Since only depreciation is charged against operating profit, this adjustment will typically increase it
