# Reading 18: Multinational Operations

## Transaction Exposure

- Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the reporting currency at the spot rate on the transaction date
  - If the rate changes a gain/loss is recognised on the settlement date
  - If the balance sheet date occurs before transaction settlement the gain/loss is based on the rate on the balance sheet date
  - On settlement an additional gain/loss is recorded in the event of further changes

## Translation of Foreign Currency Denominated Financial Statements of Subsidiaries

- There are two methods of consolidating financial statements of multinational operations
  - *Temporal method*
  - *Current rate method*
- The appropriate method depends on any differences between:
  - *Presentation currency* &rarr; The currency of the parent
  - *Functional currency* &rarr; The currency in which most cash generation and usage occurs
  - *Local currency* &rarr; The currency of the subsidiary's local market
- The requirements for reporting are:
  - Results of operations must be measured in the functional currency
  - Self-contained independent subsidiaries with operations primarily taking place in the local market will use the local currency as the functional currency
  - Subsidiaries which are well-integrated with the parent will use the parent's currency as the functional currency
- When translating from functional currency to presentation currency, use the current rate method
- When translating from local currency to functional currency, use the temporal method
- There are three choices are exchange rate when translating:
  - Current exchange rate
  - Average exchange rate over the reporting period
  - Historical exchange rate (the rate at the point in time at which a transaction took place)
- Under the current method:
  - All income statement accounts are translated at the average rate
  - All balance sheet accounts are translated at the current rate
    - Except for common stock, which translates at the historic rate
  - Dividends are translated at the historic rate
  - Translation gain or loss goes to equity
- Under the temporal method:
  - Monetary assets and liabilities translate at the current rate
  - Non-monetary assets and liabilities, as well as related expenses, translate at the historic rate
  - Common stock and dividends translate at the historic rate
  - Revenues, and all remaining expenses, translate at the average rate
  - Translation gain or loss goes to income

| Account | Temporal method rate | Current method rate |
| - | - | - |
| Monetary assets/liabilities | Current rate | Current rate |
| Non-monetary assets/liabilities | Historical rate | Current rate |
| Common stock | Historical rate | Historical rate |
| Equity | Mixed[^1] | Current rate [^2] |
| Revenues and SG\&A | Average rate | Average rate |
| COGS | Historical rate | Average rate |
| Depreciation | Historical rate | Average rate |
| Net income | Mixed [^1] | Average rate |
| Exposure | Net monetary assets | Shareholder's equity |
| Exchange rate gain/loss | Income statement | Equity |

## Calculating the Translation Gain or Loss

- Translating using the current rate exposes the accounts to exchange rate risk, leading to gains/losses
$$ \text{exposure under the current rate method} = \text{assets} - \text{liabilities} = \text{shareholder's equity} $$
$$ \text{exposure under the temporal rate method} = (\text{cash} + \text{accounts receivable}) - (\text{accounts payable} + \text{current debt} + \text{long-term debt}) = \text{net monetary assets} $$
- Under the current rate method the gains/losses go to equity as part of comprehensive income, as part of the *cumulative translation adjustment*
- Under the temporal method the gain/loss goes to the income statement
- The effect of currency appreciation/depreciation may need to be disaggregated from actual performance

## Comparing Subsidiary Results to Translated Results (Current Rate Method)

- Foreign currency translation effects can be summarised thusly:
  - Pure balance sheet and pur income statement ratios don't change
  - If the local currency is depreciating, mixed ratios will increase
  - If the local currency is appreciating, mixed ratios will decrease
- Retained earnings is a "plug" that may change to ensure that the balance sheet balances

## Accounting for Inflation and Hyperinflation

- The treatment for hyperinflation depends on the relevant accounting standards
  - GAAP &rarr; The temporal method is used, translating non-monetary assets at a historical rate
  - IFRS &rarr; Amounts are restated for current inflation, and then translated at the current rate
- Hyperinflation is defined as cumulative inflation of more than 100% in a two year period
- Inflation leads to depreciation of a currency
  - A net asset position in a depreciating currency leads to a loss

## Effective Tax Rate

- *Effective* tax rate and *statutory* tax rate can differ due to multinational corporations being subject to multiple tax jurisdictions
- Forecasting changes in the mix of profits earned in different countries can be used to predict future tax expenses

## Earnings Sustainability

- Multinational revenues are translated into the reportin currency for financial statements
- Revenue growth can occur due to changes in exchange rates
- This growth should be separated out in order to assess sustainability of different components of revenue growth

[^1]: Net income and Equity have mixed rates because they include components translated with different rates
[^2]: Total equity has to be taken as a whole at the current rate in order for the balance sheet to balance
