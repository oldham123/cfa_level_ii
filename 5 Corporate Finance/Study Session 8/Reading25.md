# Reading 25: Corporate Governance

## Definition of Corporate Governance

- Corporate governance is defined by McEnally and Kim as the 'system of principles, policies, procedures, and clearly defined responsibilities and accountabilities used by stakeholders to overcome conflicts of interest inherent in the corporate form'
- Conflicts of interest are severe in corporations due to the principal-agent problem causes by separation of ownership and management
- Corporate governance systems are primarily concerned with principal-agent problems between:
  - Managers and shareholders
  - Directors and shareholders
- The key objectives of a corporate governance system are:
  - Eliminate or reduce conflicts of interest
  - Ensure that firm assets are used in the best interests of investors and stakeholders

## Principal-Agent Problems and Solutions

- Managers may serve their own interests and not those of shareholders by engaging in the following:
  - Expanding the size of the firm excessively
  - Granting themselves excessive compensation
  - Investing in ventures where returns don't compensate for the risks taken
  - Being unreasonably risk-averse
- The following are examples of best practices in corporate governance:
  - 75% of board members should be independent
  - CEO and Chairman should be separate positions
  - Directors should be knowledgeable and experienced, and not serve on more than three boards so they have sufficient time to dedicate to each
  - The board should hold annual, non-staggered elections
  - The board should be annually evaluated and assessed
  - Board members should meet annually without management presence
  - The finance committee includes only independent directors with finance expertise
  - The finance comittee meets annually with auditors
  - Only independent directors serve on the nominating committee
  - Most of senior management's compensation is tied to performance
  - The board seeks undependent and external counsel
  -  The board is required to approve related-party transaction
- Empirical studies show that strong corporate governance increases profitability and shareholder returns
