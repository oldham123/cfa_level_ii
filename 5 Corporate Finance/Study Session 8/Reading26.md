# Reading 26: Mergers and Acquisitions

## Categorisation of Mergers and Acquisitions

- A *statutory merger* results in the target ceasing to exist
- A *subsidiary merger* results in the target continuing to exist as a subsidiary of the buyer
- A *consolidation* results in both the target and the buyer ceasing to exist, and then forming a new entity

## Types of Merger

- *Horizontal mergers* occur when firms in similar sectors combine
- *Vertical mergers* occur when firms at different levels in the same supply chain combine
- *Conglomerate mergers* occur when firms that are seemingly unrelated combine

## Motivations for M&A Activity

- Common reasons to engage in mergers or acquisitions include:
  - Achieve synergies
  - Increase rate of growth
  - Increase power in the market
  - Gain access to unique capabilities of a firm
  - Diversify
  - Gain personal benefits for managers
  - Realise tax benefits
  - Unlock hidden value for a struggling firm
  - Achieve international business goals
  - Bootstrap earnings
- Bootstrapping is a technique which may be performed by a firm with a high P/E ratio
  - By acquiring a firm with a low P/E ratio, whilst the total earnings of the combined firm are the same as before, the total shares outstanding for the new combination is less than before
  - This results in a higher reported earnings per share, despite a possible lack of economic gains

## Transaction Characteristics

- Stock purchases give target shareholders cash, or shares of the acquiring company's stock in exchange for their shares of the target
  - Stock purchases are common in cases where the target is likely to be hostile, because these offers can go straight to shareholders, bypassing management
- Asset purchases make a payment directly to the target in return for specific assets, usually avoiding assumption of liabilities

## Method of Payment

- Payment can be made using cash, stock, or a combination
  - A stock offering is made with a given ratio, which determines the number of shares of the acquirer, a target stockholder will receive per share of the target they own
- When determining which payment method is best, three main factors are at play:
  - Distribution of risk and reward
    - A cash offer results in the acquirer assuming the risk and potential reward, whilst the target receives a definite payoff equivalent to the excess of the cash offer over the target value
    - An acquirer that is confident that an acquisition will result in significant synergies would prefer to pay in cash so that they benefit from the returns to the transaction
    - A target that is uncertain about possible synergies would also prefer to pay in cash, since the payoff in that scenario is pre-determined with little risk
  - Capital structure implications
  - Relative valuations of the target and acquirer

## Attitude of Target Management

- Acquirer and target work together to perform the necessary due diligence and negotiate a mutually beneficial deal in a friendly merger
- In a hostile merger however, the acquirer may seek to avoid dealing with management altogether, instead submitting the proposal directly to the board of directors, which is called a *bear hug*
  - One way the acquirer can proceed is a *tender offer*, in which the acquirer offers to buy the shares directly from shareholders
  - The alternative is a proxy battle, in which the acquirer seeks to gain shareholder approval of a new board of directors chosen by them

## Takeover Defense

- Defenses that can be implemented before takeover attempts include:
  - Poison pills
    - These are options given to current shareholders giving them the right to purchase additional stock at extremely advantageous prices
      - A flip-in pill applies to target shares
      - A flip-out pill applies to acquirer shares
    - Poison pills can usually be redeemed by the board of directors if there is a friendly takeover event
  - Poison puts
    - This gives bondholders the right to demand repayment if there is a hostile takeover
  - Reincorporating in a state with strict laws restricting takeovers
  - Staggered board elections
    - Staggering elections make it more difficult for acquirers to engage in proxy battles
  - Restricted voting rights
  - Supermajority voting requirements
  - Fair price amendments
    - These are restrictions on mergers unless a fair price, usually determined by some formula, is offered to curretn shareholders
  - Golden parachutes
    - These are guarantees of large payments to the managers of a target on leaving the firm after a takeover
- Defenses that are implemented following the initiation of a hostile takeover include:
  - "Just say no" defense
  - Litigation
    - May be used as a delaying tactic to arrange the use of other defenses in the meantime, such as locating a white knight
  - Greenmail
    - This involves paying the potential acquirer to leave the target alone, usually involves a committment from the acquirer to not make another attempt for a given amount of time
  - Share repurchases
    - The target may launch a competing offer for the shares owned by shareholders
  - Leveraged recapitalisation
    - The target may take on a significant amount of debt in order to finance a large share repurchase, altering the firm's capital structure to make it less attractive
  - "Crown jewel" defense
    - This defense involves selling an asset that is key to the value of a target, making the takeover less desirable
      - May be declared illegal
  - "Pac-man" defense
    - The target may make a counter-offer to purchase the acquirer
      - Rarely used since it involves a smaller company acquiring a larger one, and the process may prevent the use of other tactics
  - White knight
    - The target may seek another acquirer to make a counteroffer, in order to fend of the initial attemp
      - The competitive process that results leads to something called the *winner's curse*, which is the tendency for the winner to end up overpaying
  - White squire
    - This defense involves finding a third party that may simply purchase a portion of the target, instead the entire firm, making the target less attractive

## Herfindahl-Hirschman Index

$$
\text{HHI} = \sum^n_{i=1} (\text{MS}_\text{i}\times100)^2
$$

- This index is an indication of how concentrated a market is, and whether an antitrust challenge is likely following a merger
- The likelihood of a challenge is determined by two factors:
  - The post-merger value of the index
  - The change in the index caused by the merger
- If the new value of the index is less than 1000, then the industry is not considered concentrated
  - No change in the value of the index will be enough to invite a challenge
- If the new value is between 1,000 and 1,800 then the industry is considered moderately concentrated
  - If the change in the index is 100 or more, then a challenge is likely
- If the new value is greater than 1,800, then the industry is considered highly concentrated
  - The change in the index only needs to be 50 or greater before a challenge is likely

## Valuing a Merger Target

- There are multiple methods an acquirer might use to value a potential target
  - Discounted free cash flow
  - Comparable companies
  - Comparable transactions

## Evaluating a Merger Bid

- The value of an entity following a merger is equal to $V_\text{aqc.} + V_\text{tar.} + \text{synergies} - \text{cash paid}$
  - Note that the values used in this equation should be the values of the target and the acquirer before any news about a potential merger causes them to shift
- The gain that accrues to the target is equal to the target price, minus the target value
  - The gain that accrues to the acquirer is equal to realised synergies, minus the gain to the target
- When the offer is made with cash, shareholders in the target firm receive a payoff equivalent to the cash offers excess over the value of the firm
- In the event of a stock offer, the shareholders retain a stake in the new entity, meaning the payoff to them in uncertain, similarly to the payoff to the acquirers, and depends on:
  - The realisation of synergies
  - The ratio of the stock offer
  - The total number of shares in the resulting merged entity is equal to the number of shares in the acquirer, plus the number of shares in the target, divided by the number of acquirer shares that is being offered per target share
    - For example, if the acquirer had 100 shares outstanding, the target had 50 shares outstanding, and the acquirer was offering one share in return for every two shares of the target, then the final number of shares would be $100 + \frac{50}{2} =125$
    - The value of the combined entity plus synergies can now be apportioned out based on the split of shares between acquirer and target, to calculate the final takeover premium given synergies

## Effect of Price and Payment Method

- In a cash offer, the acquirer assumes all risk and return, whilst the gain to the shareholders in the target is certain and limited to the premium over target value that they receive
  - In the event that synergies are greater than expected, the gains to the acquirer increase, whilst gains to the target remain where they are
  - If synergies fail to materialise, the reverse is true
- In a stock offer, some of the risk and potential reward shifts to the target firm
- The more realistic the estimate of synergies, the more an acquirer will want to pay with cash, and the more a target will want to be paid with stock

## Types of Restructuring

- Cash divestitures involve the sale of a division to another party for cash
- Equity carve-outs involve the creation of a new independent firm, by giving a proportionate stake of the original firm to outside investors through a public offer
- Spin-offs create a new independent firm by offering new stock to investors in the original firm
- Split-offs allow shareholders to receive new shares of a new division, by exchanging shares of the parent
- Liquidations break up the firm and sell all assets piece by piece

## Voluntary Divestitures

- Divestitures may occur for one of the following reasons
  - A division may no longer be a good fit for the firm's long term strategy
  - A division may have poor results
  - The combination of divisions present in the firm may result in an inefficiency, or a "reverse synergy"
  - To raise cash
