# Reading 24: Corporate Performance, Governance, and Business Ethics

# Stakeholder Impact Analysis

- An SIA should:
  - Identify stakeholders
  - Identify interests of stakeholders
  - Identify demands of each group on firm
  - Prioritise stakeholders
  - Devise business strategy

## Principal-Agent Relationship Problems

- A principal-agent relationship is one in which an *agent* is authorised to make decisions on behalf of a *principal*
  - The agent usually has better information, which can enable exploitation of the principal
- To deal with this, principals should develop procedures that:
  - Set goals and standards that restrain agent actions
  - Redress the information asymmetry
  - Remove agents who do not behave in the interests of the principal

## Causes of Unethical Behaviour

- Unethical behaviour of agents can arise from multiple sources:
  - Agents with flawed personal ethics
  - A failure to realise that a decision will create an ethics ciolation
  - A culture focused only on profit
  - The setting of unrealistic goals

## Theories of Ethical Decision-Making

- The Friedman Doctrine states that the only social responsibility is to increase profits "within the rules of the game", through "open and fair competition without deception or fraud"
- Utilitarianism states that firms must seek to produce the highest good for the greatest number
- Kantian ethics argues that people are not just factors of production, but that they themselves deserve dignity and respect
- Rights theory argues that there are fundamental rights that a person possesses, that ought not be violated under any circumstance
- Justice theories speak of a "just" distribution of economic output
  - Rawls argued that such a distribution would come about if that distribution was done from behind a "veil of ignorance"
