# Reading 22: Capital Structure and Leverage

## Objective of the Capital Structure Decision

- Capital structure should be chosen to determine the optimal mix of debt and equity financing to minimise the WACC
  - This will also maximise firm value

## Capital Structure Theory

- *MM Proposition I (No taxes)* states that capital structure has no consequences for firm value
- *MM Proposition II (No taxes)* states that the cost of equity increases linearly as the proportion of debt financing increases
  - This is because the business risk of the firm becomes concentrated on a smaller proportion of equity
  - The benefits of using more debt are cancelled out by the increased cost of equity, yielding no impact on the WACC
- *MM Proposition I (With taxes)* states that value is maximised with complete debt financing, so as to benefit from the debt tax shield
- *MM Proposition II (With taxes)* states that WACC is minimised at complete debt financing

## Costs and Their Potential Effect on the Capital Structure

- Costs of financial distress arise when earnings fall, leading to difficulty in meeting debt obligations:
  - Costs of financial distress and bankruptcy
  - Probability of financial distress
- Increased leverage leads to increased expected costrs of financial distress, and increased liklihood of financial distress
- The *net agency costs* of equity arise from the conflict of interest between managers and owners:
  - Costs of monitoring
  - Costs of bonding
  - Residual losses
- Costs of information asymmetry are due to managers having more information about performance than owners

## The Capital Structure Decision

- MM’s propositions with no taxes imply that capital structure has no implications for firm value
- MM’s propositions with taxes imply that the best capital structure is always one of 100% debt financing (due to the debt tax shield)
- *Pecking order theory* suggests that managers are incentivised to inform shareholders as little as possible, and will make financing decisions that send the least visible signals to shareholders, preferring internal capital first, then debt, then equity
- *Static trade-off theory* states that there is an optimal capital structure that balances the increased costs of financial distress resulting from debt financing, with the benefits of the debt tax shield
- Considering the costs of financial distress, the value of a firm engaging in borrowing can be expresses thusly:
  - $V_\text{levered} = V + (\text{tax rate} \times \text{debt}) - \text{PV(financial distress cost)}$

## Factors to Consider For Analysis

- Capital structure changes over time
- Competitor capital structures
- Agency costs and related items, such as corporate governance quality

## International Differences in Leverage

- The following factors may result in differences in leverage choices internationally:
  - Institutional, legal, and taxation factors
    - Large institutional investors have the ability to analyse companies and reduce information asymmetries, reducing the use of debt
    - Firms in countries with weak legal systems tend to have greater use of debt
  - Financial market and banking system factors
    - A high reliance on the banking system for credit leads to increased leverage
  - Macroeconomic factors
