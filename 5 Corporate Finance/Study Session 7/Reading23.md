# Reading 23: Dividends and Dividend Policy

## Dividend Types

- *Regular cash dividends* are periodic and paid in cash
  - *Residual dividends* are a type of cash dividend, where the dividend amount is calculated as the earnings remaining after the needs of a predetermined capital budget are met
    - A longer-term residual dividend policy forecasts capital budget requirements over a long time frame, resulting in more stable payouts
- *Special dividends* are irregular, also paid in cash
- *Liquidating dividends* are dividends paid in excess of cumulative retained earnings, or are paid in part (or all) of a firm is sold
- *Stock dividends/splits* are paid by issuance of more stock
  - They do not affect the current, quick, or leverage ratios since they do not take the form of cash outflows

## Dividend Theories

- Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani claim that dividend policy has no impact on stock price or cost of capital, and is therefore irrelevant, due to the concept of *homemade dividends*
  - If an investor thinks that a dividend is too large, the additional cash can be used to purchase more stock, until the dividend is at the preferred level
  - If an investor thinks that a dividend is too small, additional cash can be gained by selling stock
  - In both cases, the value of the investor’s interest in the firm, plus the value of cash in hand, is the same
- *Dividend preference theory* states that investors prefer current cash to future capital gains, due to the increased certainty of cash received now
- *Tax aversion theory* states that investors prefer buybacks, so that they do not incur taxes on dividends paid out, especially if the taxes on dividends are higher than those on capital gains

## Signaling Effect

- The notion of the signaling effect of a change in dividend policy is predicated on the idea that such changes can be used to deduce the future earnings expectations of management
  - Unexpected increases are seen positively
  - Unexpected decreases are seen negatively
- The signaling effects of dividend policies can differ internationally
  - In the USA, even small changes in a dividend can send major signals about a firm's future prospects
  - In Asian countries, such as Japan, investors are less likely to infer anything from even a large change in dividends

## Clientele Effect

- Different groups of investors have different preferences regarding dividend policies
  - The clientele effect refers to these preferences, and a firm’s attempt to align their policies with the preferences of their clientele
  - Miller and Modigliani however point out that changing dividend policy simply changes clienteles, without affecting firm value

## Taxation

- In the USA, dividends are taxed twice:
  - Once as corporate income
  - Then again when distributed to shareholders as dividends
- $\text{effective div. tax rate} = \text{corp. tax} + \text{individual tax} \times (1 - \text{corp. tax})$
- A *split-rate* tax system taxes distributed earnings at a lower level than retained earnings
- An *imputation* tax system taxes all earnings at the shareholder rate
  - Under this system, a shareholder would deduct taxes paid by the corporation from their own tax return
  - The shareholder then receives a credit / pays additional tax based on any difference between the corporate rate and individual rate

## Stable Dividend Policy

- Because of the signaling effect of a change in the dividend payment ratio, firms tend to prefer a stable dividend policy
- A *payout adjustment* model can be used to move gradually to a target payout, to avoid significant alterations to investor expectations as a firm moves from one level to another

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{exp. div. increase} = [(&\text{ exp. earnings} \times \text{target payout ratio }) - \text{prev. div.}]\\ 
\times &\frac{1}{\text{years to adjust}}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Good reasons to reduce the payment ratio despite the signaling effect might be:
  - An increase in interest rates makes the use of retained earnings as an internal source of project financing, a firm's preferred option (by pecking-order theory) more viable
  - A decrease in the capital gains tax means that shareholder wealth is best increased by appreciating the stock price than by paying out cash dividends

## Share Repurchase Methods

- *Open market transactions*
  - This method allows repurchase at the most favourable terms
  - American companies do not need shareholder approval for this, unlike European companies
- *Tender offers*
  - This approach entails buying a fixed number of shares at a predetermined price (usually at a premium over the market price)
  - This method is faster but less flexible
  - If more than the required number of shareholders respond to the offer, a prorated share of stock will usually be purchased from each
- *Dutch auctions*
  - In this approach, there is no fixed price, but a range of prices
  - These auctions identify the minimum price required for the desired number of shares, by allowing each shareholders to specify a price and a number of shares to offer
  - Offers are accepted sequentially, best prices first, with the price of the final offer setting the price that every shareholder receives
  - Therefore, offering a lower prices as a shareholder increases the chance that you will be accepted into the transaction
- *Direct negotiation*
  - This approach involves purchasing shares from one major shareholder, usually at a premium over the market price
  - This approach is often used in a greenmail scenario, where the victim of a hostile takeover offers an attractive price in order to tempt the potential acquirer to back off
  - Many negotiated repurchased can settle at a discount, in the event that shareholders are worried about the lack of a liquid market for their shares if they turn down the offer

## The Impact of Buybacks on EPS and BVPS

- Financing a buyback with cash causes an increase in EPS, if the earnings yield (current EPS divided by the stock price) exceeds the yield on cash
  - EPS after the buyback is calculated by subtracting the cost of the shares purchased from earnings, and then dividing by the remaining shares
- Financing a buyback with debt causes an increase in EPS, if the earnings yield is less than the after-tax cost of debt
  - EPS after the buyback is calculated by subtracting the after-tax cost of debt required from total earnings, and dividing by the remaining shares
  - Note that using debt to finance a buyback will also increase leverage, and hence the cost of capital, so a stock price increase may not necessarily result, despite an increased EPS
- If the price paid per share exceeds BVPS, then BVPS will decrease, as the transaction represents an outflow of wealth

## Share Repurchase Rationale

- If capital gains are taxed favourably to dividends, share repurchases are a tax efficient way to distribute wealth to shareholders
- Taking ownership of more stock is a way for management to signal their positive expectations for the firm
- Investors expect dividends to be stable, and it is hard to avoid the negative signalling that results from a reduction
  - Repurchases provide flexibility, reducing the need for ‘sticky’ dividends in the future
- Repurchases can offset the impact of stock dilution due to employee stock options
- Repurchases can increase financial leverage by reducing equity in the balance sheet

## Dividend Coverage Ratios

- Dividend sustainability is a major area of focus for analysts, due to the importance of the signaling effects of changes in dividend policy
- Two ratios used to assess the sustainability of a dividend policy are:
  - $\text{Dividend coverage ratio} = \frac{\text{NI}}{\text{dividends}}$

- $\text{FCFE coverage ratio} = \frac{\text{FCFE}}{\text{dividends} + \text{repurchases}}$
  - An FCFE coverage ratio significantly less than one is considered unsustainable, implying that the firm is simply drawing down cash reserves for the benefit of sending positive signals through dividends
