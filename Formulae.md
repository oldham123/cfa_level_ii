## Financial Statement Analysis

### Cash Conversion Cycle

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Cash conversion cycle } & = \text{Days sales outstanding} + \text{Days inventory outstanding} - \text{Days payables outstanding} \\
\text{Days sales outstanding } & = \frac{\text{Avg.(Accounts receivable)}}{\text{Daily revenue}} \\
\text{Days inventory outstanding } & = \frac{\text{Avg.(Inventory)}}{\text{Daily COGS}} \\
\text{Days payables outstanding } & = \frac{\text{Avg.(Accounts payable)}}{\text{Daily COGS}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

- Representation of how many days it takes to collect cash from sales
- Takes the form of the operating cycle (days to receive cash from a buyer) minus days of accounts payable, to account for use of credit to finance the sale (i.e. by borrowing from suppliers), and receive cash sooner

### Receivables Turnover

$$
\text{Receivables turnover } = \frac{\text{Annual sales}}{\text{Avg.(Accounts receivable)}}
$$

- A measure of earnings quality expressing the effectiveness of a firm's credit policy
  - A low figure indicates a lenient policy of offering customers generous financing

### Aggregate Accruals and Accruals Ratio

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Aggregate accruals } & = \text{Net income} - \text{Cash flow from operations} - \text{Cash flow from investing} \\
\text{Accruals ratio } & = \frac{\Delta\text{Net operating assets}}{\frac{1}{2} \cdot (\text{Net operating assets}_\text{initial} + \text{Net operating assets}_\text{final}) }
\end{aligned}
$$
