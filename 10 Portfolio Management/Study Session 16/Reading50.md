# Reading 50: Economics and Investment Markets

## Short-Term Interest Rates

- Interest rates and GDP growth rate are positively related, as are interest rates and GDP growth volatility
- During recessions, short-term policy rates are typically low
  - As economies exit recessions, expectations of future growth and inflation increase longer-term rates, leading to a yield curve with a positive slope
  - Similarly, a yield curve with a negative slope is an indicator of pessimistic expectations, and thought to be a predictor of future recession

## Yield Spreads Between Non-Inflation-Adjusted and Inflation-Indexed Bonds

$$\text{Break-even inflation} = \text{non-inflation-indexed yield} - \text{inflation-indexed yield}$$

- BEI has two components, expected inflation $\pi$ and a risk premium for inflation uncertainty $\theta$

## Credit Spreads

- Credit spreads tend to rise during downturns, and shrink during expansions
- When spreads are narrow, lower-rated bonds tend to outperform higher-rated bonds
  - This is because the compensation to investors for accepting higher credit risk was predicated on higher spreads, and more credit risk
  - As spreads narrow, investors continue to be compensated for that credit risk, but the risk inherent in their holding is now lower
- Spreads for cyclical issuers are more volatile and more sensitive to business cycles than non-cyclical issuers

## Equity Securities and Business Cycles

- Equities are typically cyclical
  - They perform well when the economy is performing well and have poor consumption hedging properties
  - Hence the risk premium on equities is positive

## Influence of Economics on Commercial Real Estate

- Commercial real-estate has characteristics both of equity securities, and of bond securities
  - Commercial real-estate provides a regular income stream, and a terminal value at the end of the term
  - The discount rate includes a risk premium to compoensate for uncertainty in the terminal value, and also for illiquidity
