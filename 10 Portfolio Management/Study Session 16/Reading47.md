# Reading 47: The Portfolio Management Process and the Investment Policy Statement

## Steps of the Portfolio Management Process

- Portfolio management has three main phases, planning, execution, and feedback
  - The planning phase has the following four steps:
    - Analysing objectives and constraints
    - Developing an IPS
    - Determining the appropriate investment strategy
    - Selecting an appropriate asset allocation

## Investment Objectives

- Risk objectives are associated with both willingness and ability to accept risk
  - These factors are accounted for in a single factor: *risk tolerance*
  - Willingness to tolerate risk is usually psychological
    - Some clients may feel well-informed or financially-savvy, or they may simply be natural risk-takers
    - Client statements should by interpreted as indicators of willingness to take risk, not ability
  - Ability to take risk should exclusively be determined by portfolio size, client time horizon, and the client's liquidity needs
  - Any divergence in willingness and ability should be corrected through education
- Return objectives can be a desired return, or a required return, and should be consistent with risk objectives
  - They should be clear on the implications of inflation and tax, and should consider returns from a *total return perspective* (i.e. one that accounts for both dividends and capital gains)

## Investment Constraints

- Liquidity constraints relate to the need for cash flows in the future
  - This constraint will influence risk taking ability, and therefore return objectives
- Time horizon constaints relate to the time period during which the investor's capital will be invested
  - This constraint also affects both risk taking abiliity, and thus return objectives
- Tax constraints ensure that investment choices are made with careful regard to the client's tax situation
- Legal and regulatory constraints are mainly a concern for large insitutional investors
- Additionally, investors can have unique personal circumstances that may result in unique types of constraint
- An overview of typical return objectives for different types of investor is given below:
  - Individual investors have requirements depending on their financial positions and life cycle stage
  - Defined benefit pension plans require a return sufficient to fund their pension liability
  - Defined contribution plans' requirements depend on the life cycle stage of beneficiaries
  - Endowments and foundations require returns sufficient to cover spending needs and expenses
  - Life insurance compenies require returns dependent on policy holder reserve rates
  - Other insurance companies require returns determined by their financial strength and their policy pricing
  - Banks have needs determined by their cost of funds
- An overview of typical risk objectives for different types of investor is given below:
  - Individual investor risk objectives dependon life cycle stage and financial position
  - Defined benefit pension plan risk objectives depend on the features and funded status of the plan, as well as the age of the workforce
  - Risk objectives of a defined contribution plan depend on risk tolerance of beneficiaries
  - Endowments and foundations have risk objectives that are generally average or above average
  - Insurance companies have below average risk objectives due to regulatory requirements
  - Banks have risk objectives that are dependent on their financial strength and business model

## Investment Policy Statement

- The IPS is a formal written document that functions as a guide to investment decision making for a portfolio, containing:
  - Guidance for investment advisor decisions
  - promotes long-term discipline in investment decision making
  - Protects against short-term shift in strategy due to either panic or over-confidence
- A suitable IPS should specify;
  - A client's situation
  - The purpose of the portfolio
  - An identification of responsibilities
  - Formal statements of risk and return objectives, as well as constraints
  - A schedule of reviews of both portfolio performance, as well as the IPS itself
  - Asset allocation ranges, and guidance for rebalcning and adjustment activities

## Strategic Asset Allocation

- Three approaches to investment that are common are:
  - *Passive investment*, including strategies such as indexing, and buy-and-hold
  - *Active investment*, which includes managing for positive alpha, or investing according to a specific style, or in a specified sector / industry
  - *Semi-active, risk-controlled active* or *enhanced active* strategies include index tilting, where a manager adjusts weights of certain portions of an index based on market expectations
