# Reading 14: Economic Growth and the Investment Decision

## Pre-conditions for Economic Growth

- The following all contribute to a high growth rate:
  - High levels of savings and investment
    - If there are insufficient domestic savings, foreign investment is required for growth
  - Developed financial markets in order to efficiently allocate capital
  - Political stability
  - High investment in human capital
    - Developed countries benefit the most from post-secondary spending
    - Less-developed countries benefit the most from spending on primary and secondary education
  - Favourable taxation and regulation
  - Free trade and capital flow

## Sustainable Growth Rates
- The rate of aggregate stock market growth is limited to the economy's *sustainable growth rate* in the long run
  - In the short run, $\Delta \text{P} = \Delta \text{GDP} + \Delta \text{E/GDP} + \Delta \text{P/E}$
  - In the long run, $\Delta \text{E/GDP}=0$, since it would necessitate labour accepting an ever decreasing share of GDP
    - Similarly, $\Delta \text{P/E}=0$ since investors will not pay ever-increasing prices for the same level of earnings

## Potential GDP

- *Potential GDP* is the maximum economic output without creating upward pressure on prices
- The difference between potential and actual GDP may be useful for predicting fiscal and monetary policy in the short run
  - Inflation is unlikely when actual GDP is below potential GDP, and so expansionary policy is more likely
- In the long run, the rate of appreciation in the aggregate stock market should equal the growth rate in potential GDP

## Capital Deepening Investment and Technological Process

- The Cobb-Douglas Production function relates aggregate economic output, and an economy's technological progress:

$$
Y = TK^\alpha L^{(1 - \alpha)}
$$

where:
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y& = \text{aggregate economic output}\\
\alpha & = \text{share of output related to capital }\\
T & = \text{total factor productivity, representing technological progress}\\
K & = \text{capital}\\
L & = \text{labour}
\end{aligned}
$$

- The function implies that output is a function of labour and capital inputs, and their productivity
- Increasing all inputs by a given percentage yields the same increase in output (i.e. there are constant returns to scale)
- *Capital deepening* is an increase in the capital-to-labour ratio
  - Returns to capital deepening are diminishing
- Technological progress improves the productivity of all inputs
- In equilibrium, the marginal product of capital is equal to the marginal cost of capital $r$

## Growth Accounting Relations

- The Cobb-Douglas production functions yields the *growth accounting relation*, relating growth in the factors of production with potential GDP growth:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta\text{GDP} = \Delta \text{T} + \alpha\cdot\Delta\text{K} + (1-\alpha)\cdot\Delta\text{L}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Alternatively, potential GDP growth can be forecast using the *labour productivity growth accounting equation*:

$$
\Delta \text{GDP} = \Delta\text{labour} + \Delta\text{labour productivity}
$$

## Theories of Economic Growth

- *Classical growth theory* suggests that growth in real GDP per capita is temporary
  - It posits that there is a subsistence level of per-capita income
  - If income levels rise above this level, there is a population increase
  - Resulting population increases eventually force GDP per capita back down again, due to diminishing returns to 
  - Hence, the theory contends that sustainable growth rates are always zero
- *Neoclassical growth theory* suggests that the sustainable growth rate is a function of population growth, labour's share of income, and the rate of technological advancement
  - The sustainable growth rate per capita is a function of technological growth divided by labour's share of output
  - Hence, $\text{sustainable growth rate per capita }g^* = \frac{\text{technological growth rate}}{1- \alpha}$
  - In equilibrium the growth rate per worker is equal to the growth rate of capital per worker
  - $\text{sustainable growth rate } G^* = g^* + \Delta L$
  - According to neoclassical theory capital deepening affects the level of output, but not the growth rate in the long run
    - Once steady-state is reaches, only further technological progress will increase the growth rate
- *Endogenous growth theory* posits that investment in capital can have constant returns, as opposed to diminishing returns
  - This is due (for example) to research and development expenditures, and positive externalities resulting from those expenditures that lead to under-investment
  - The theory holds that productivity growth is a function of the creation of knowledge capital, and real interest rates
  - This theory holds that there is no steady-state growth rate, hence increased investment can permanently increase the growth rate

## The Effect of Natural Resources on Growth

- Economic growth and ownership of natural resources are not related in a simple fashion
  - Limited natural resources do not always constrain growth since access to resources doesn't require ownership, thanks to trade
  - Ownership of resources may inhibit growth because the nation overly invests in extracting and processing those resources instead of developing other valuable components of a successful economy
  - Additionally, countries in possession of valuable resources can fall victim to excessive currency appreciation due to high demand for those resources
    - This leads to the countries other exports being uncompetitive in foreign markets

## Convergence Hypotheses
- *Absolute convergence* states that less-developed countries will appraoch the living standard of developed ones
- *Conditional convergence* states that convergence will occur given convergence on key variables:
  - Savings rate
  - Population growth
  - Production function
- *Club convergence* states that less developed countries may converge if they are in "clubs" featuring similar institutional structures, such as property rights and political stabilty
