# Reading 15: Economics of Regulation

## Regulations and Regulators

- Regulations include:
  - Statutes (laws made by legislative bodies)
  - Administrative regulations (rules issued by governmentally authorised bodies)
  - Judicial law (findings of courts)
- Regulators can be governmental, or independent
  - Independent regulators can be self-regulatory
  - Some bodies are not regulators, but they produce outputs such as standards or recommendations that are referenced by regulators
- Self-regulatory organisations without governmental authorisation or recognition are not regulators
  - They may be subject to pressure from their members
  - Some SROs, when properly supervised by regulatory agencies, have been effective in assisting in regulation
  - The most important factor in their success is their proper supervision by formal government authorities

## Economic Rationale for Regulation

- Informational frictions exist when information is not equally available to all
- Externalities are when cost is not proportional to consumption
  - e.g. The additional gains from being able to work remotely are *network externalities* of ICT investment

## Regulatory Interdependencies

- Regulatory capture is when a regulated industry gains influence over its regulator
- Regulatory arbitrage is when firms exploit the difference between the requirements imposed by regulation, and the intentions of the regulation
  - Another example is when firms exploit the differences in regulations amongst multiple jurisdictions
- Regulatory competition is a result of regulators taking actions to provide a comfortable regulatory environment in order to attrack various entities to operate in that jurisdiction

## Regulatory Tools

- Tools for regulation include:
  - Price mechanisms (taxes or subsidies)
  - Restricting or requiring activities
    - e.g. A regulator may require a certain level of disclosure to prevent firms taking a "buyer-beware" approach to investors (i.e. placing a responsibility upon investors to understand the risks)
  - The provision of public goods 
  - Financing private projects with societal benefits

## Cost/Benefit Analysis of Regulations

- The cost of compliance for the regulated entity is the *regulatory burden*
  - Indirect costs should be included, but are difficult to forecast
  - *Sunset clauses* require costs to be reconsidered when a regulation is renewed
  - A high regulatory burden on those a regulation is trying to protect can make that regulation less effective
    - e.g. Fining a company for not making timely disclosures to shareholders
