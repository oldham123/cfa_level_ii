# Reading 36: The Arbitrage-Free Valuation Framework

## Binomial Interest Rate Trees

- The binomial interest rate tree is a lognormal random walk model
  - There are two equally likely outcomes at each node
  - Interest rate volatility drives the proliferation of nodes in the model
  - The model is calibrated such that:
    - The tree gives bond prices seen in the market
    - Adjacent forward rates in one time period are two standard deviations apart
    - Hence the rate after an up-move can be given by the down-move rate, multiplied by $e^{2\sigma}$

## Valuation of Bonds

- Valuation using a binomial tree model can be done using backward induction
  - The cash flows generated by the bond at each node are discounted back to previous nodes up until $t=0$
  - The final price is an average of the values emerging from each possible path, weighted by the probabilities of each path occurring
- Pathwise valuation gives the value of the bond as the average of the values of the bond at the end of each path
  - For an n-period binomial tree there are $2^{(n-1)}$ possible paths

## Monte-Carlo Forward Rate Simulation

- Monte-Carlo simulation uses pathwise valuation and a large number of random paths
- Mortgage backed securities have path-dependent cash flows doe to embedded options, which can be accounted for in a binomial tree model

## Arbitrage-free Valuation

- Arbitrage free valuation assumes that no arbitrage profit is possible, and uses this assumption to determine a value
- Arbitrage opportunities include:
  - Value additivity, which is when the value of an asset differs from the sum of the values of a group of assets which, when taken together, replicate its characteristics
  - Dominance, which is when two assets with identical characteristics trade at different prices
- If value additivity fails to hold, then riskless profit with no initial cash outlay can be earned through either stripping, or reconstitution
  - Stripping is done when an asset can be purchased for a price less than the prices its constituent parts can be sold at
  - Reconstitution is the opposite
