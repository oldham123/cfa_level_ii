# Reading 45: Private Equity

## Sources of Value Creation

- Private equity firms add value to companies in their portfolio by:
  - Operating the firm more efficiently
  - Obtaining cheaper financing with better terms
  - Provide a superior alignment of interests between management and owners

## Control Mechanisms

- PE firms use control mechanisms to ensure interest alignment between themselves and portfolio company management
  - Managers receive compensation that is linked to performance
  - Tag-along, drag-along clauses force acquisition offers to be extended to all shareholders, including management
- The term sheet also has provisions to protect the PE firm:
  - The PE firm is ensured control through board representation if the firm experiences events such as takeover, restructuring, an IPO, bankruptcy, or liquidation
  - Company founders must sign non-compete clauses
  - PE firm owners receive their distributions of earnings before other owners, usually in the form of preferred dividends
    - They also have senior claims on firm assets
  - Changes that are strategically importance must be approved by the PE firm
  - Earn-outs tie the acquisition price eventually paid by the PE firm to the performance of the firm to be acquired over a specified period

## Exit Routes

- PE exit routes include:
  - IPOs
  - Secondary market sales
  - MBOs
  - Liquidations

## Valuation Characteristics of Venture Capital Investments and Buyouts

- Venture Capital investments have the following characteristics:
  - Cash flow projects are uncertain
  - The product market is usually new with unclear prospects
  - VC targets usually have weak asset bases
  - Management teams are often new
  - Financing is majority equity-based
  - Risk is difficult to assess due to a lack of historical data, and uncertainty in many areas
  - Outcome of PE exit is difficult to forecast
  - Operations burn through cash quickly
  - Working capital requirements increase due to growth
  - Due diligence on financial matters is limited due to a lack of firm history, but investigation into the nature of the product and its technology is extensive
  - Goals take the form of milestones in business plans and growth strategies
  - Returns usually emerge from a minority of investments which are significantly profitable, offsetting writeoffs from less successful investments
  - VC targets are generally not active in capital markets
  - Most firms are sold as a result of a relationship between the target and the VC firm
  - Firms are typically less scalable as subsequent funding is reduced
- Buyout investments typically display the following:
  - Cash flows are stable and predictable
  - They have a strong market position with established products
  - They have a substantial asset base which can serve as collateral
  - They have a strong and experienced management team
  - They usually have large amounts of debt, with a large percentage of senior debt, and substantial amounts of more junior debt
  - The timing and nature of exit is usually predictable
  - There is usually potential for reduction in inefficiencies
  - There are low working capital requirements due to lower, more stable growth
  - Thorough due diligence is performed regarding all aspects of the target firm
  - Goals are expressed in terms of cash flows, as well as a strategic and business plan
  - Returns to the PE firm are typically lower, but with significantly fewer failures
  - The target firms are usually active in capital markets
  - Firms are typically sold through an auction
  - Strong performers can secure further funding
- Issues related to VC investment include:
  - Low applicability of DCF valuation
  - Low applicability of relative valuation
- Issues related to Buyout investment include:
  - High use of debt compared to VC firms
- The costs of investing in PE are significantly higher than with publicly traded securities, and include multiple additional costs

## Quantitative Measures

- Quantitative measures relevant to PE investments include:

  - *Net asset value* is the value of a fund's assets, minus it's liabilities
    - NAV before distributions is calculated as the ending NAV of the previous year, with any additional capital paid in added, and management fees subtracted, as well as operating results taken into account
  - *Carried interest* is the general partner's share of profits (usually 20%), and is not earned until the fund's NAV exceeds committed capital
  - *Paid in capital*, the percent of committed or absolute amount of capital utilised by the general partner
  - *Percentage management fee*, the management fee charged divided by the amount of paid-in capital
  - *Distributed paid in capital*, the cumulative distributions paid to the limited partners divided by the cumulative investment capital, new of management fees and carried interest
  - *Residual value to paid in capital*, the limited partner's unrealised return, equal to the value of the limited partner's holdings in the fund divided by the cumulative invested capital, also net of management fees and carried interest
  - *Total value to paid in capital*, the sum of distributed and residual value to paid in capital
  - *Transaction fees* are paid to the general partner for additional advisory services, and are usually split evenly with the limited partners, and are deducted from management fees
  - The *ratchet* specifies the allocation of equity between stockholders and management of portfolio companies, and usually allows management to increase their allocation, contingent on strong performance

  - There are two methods VC firms use to calculate the percentage $f$ of a target owned after an investment round:
    - NPV method: $f = \frac{\text{investment}}{\text{PV(firm value at exit)}}$
    - IRR method: $f = \frac{\text{FV(value of investment at exit)}}{\text{FV(value of firm at exit)}}$
    - These should be equal provided the discount rates are the same
