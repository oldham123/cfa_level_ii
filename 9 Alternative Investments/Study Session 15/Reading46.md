# sReading 46: Commodities and Commodity Derivatives - An Introduction

## Characteristics of Commodity Sectors

- Commodity sectors include:
  - Energy
    - Crude oil must be refined for use, but may be transported before refining
    - Natural gas can be used in its raw form but must be liquified for transportation
  - Industrial and precious metals
    - Cyclical demand, but easy to store for long periods
  - Grains and softs / cash crops
    - Production is sensitive to weather conditions
  - Livestock
    - Supply is sensitive to grain prices

## Commodity Sector Life Cycles

- A commodity life cycle is the time taken to produce, transport, store, and process
  - Crude oil production requires well drilling, extraction and transportation, a short period of storage, refining, then final delivery to customers
  - Natural gas production involves little processing, but transportation requires liquification
  - Metal production involves the mining, and then smelting, of ore, necessitating the construction of large plants and expensive equipment
  - Livestock production cycles can vary depending on the animal, but all meat can be frozen for both transportation and storage
  - Grain production is seasonal, but storage is possible, with growing seasons occuring at opposite times of the year in the northern and southern hemispheres
  - Softs require warm climates, and have varying production cycles and storage requirements

## Commodity Valuation

- The spot price of a commodity may be viewed as the present value of a future selling price
  - Costs (storage) and benefits of carry can create divergence between spot and forward prices

## Contango and Backwardation

- The difference between the spot and futures price for a commodity is the *basis*
- The difference between futures prices for a longer-term contract and a shorter-term contract is the *calendar spread*
- Contango describes a situation where futures prices are greater than spot prices
- Backwardation describes a sitation where futures prices are less than spot prices

## Theories of Futures Returns

- According to *insurance theory*, futures returns are compensation to buyers for insuring sellers against price movements, hence the futures price is the spot price minus some "insurance premium" paid by the seller in return for locking in a price now
  - Hence the theory imples that backwardation is a normal condition, due to sellers of commodities going short in futures contracts in order to protect themselves from price falls (i.e. "short-hedging")
  - The *hedging pressure hypothesis* expands this theory by considering buyers as hedgers also, paying a premium to lock in a price now, and protect themselves against price rises (i.e. "long-hedging")
  - Whether markets are in backwardation or contango depends on whether short or long hedgers dominate
- The *theory of storage* further complicates this picture by considering costs of carry (such as storage costs) and convenience yields (profit from benefiting from shortages in a commodity)

## Total Return of a Fully Collateralised Futures Contract

- The three components of fully collateralised futures return are:
  - Collateral return, the yield on securities deposited as collateral
  - Price return, produced by a change in spot prices
  - Roll return, created by re-establishing closed positions in longer dated contracts

## Roll Return in Backwardation and Contango

- When the market is in backwardation, investors than re-establish the same futures position at a lower price, by buying the same contracts, which are now priced more cheaply
- When the market is in contango, roll return is negative, due to there now being an additional cost associated with establishing the same position since prices have increased

## Impact of Index Construction on Commodity Index Returns

- Commodity index returns can be affected by index structure, and methodology
  - Choices regarding rebalancing method and frequency, weighting method, and index components all impact returns

## Commodity Swaps

- There are three types of swap on commodities:
  - An *excess return* swap results in variable payments depending on the difference between the price of a commodity and a benchmark value
  - A *basis* swap results in variable payments resulting from the difference in price between two commodities
  - A *total return* swap results in variable payments resulting from the change in price of a single commodity
