## Real Estate Valuation

- *The cost approach* determines value by adding the value of the land to the replacement cost of the building on the land, less adjustments for estimated depreciation and obsolescence

  - Steps of the cost approach are as follows:
    - Estimate land value
    - Estimate building replacement cost
    - Deduct depreciation, including:
      - Physical deterioration
      - Functional obsolescence
      - Locational obsolescence
      - Economic obsolescence
  - The cost approach is most useful when:
    - The property is new
    - The property is unusual
    - The property lacks comparable transactions

- *The income approach* can be done in two different ways:

  - *The direct capitalisation* approach capitalises the first year net-operating income of the property using a capitalisation rate
    - $\text{Cap. rate} = \text{discount rate} - \text{growth rate}$
    - $\text{Cap. rate} = \frac{\text{NOI}_1}{\text{comparable sales price}}$
    - The gross income multiplier is another means of direct capitalisation, also obtained from comparable transactions
    - If tenants are required to pay all expenses, a cap rate mayu be applied to rent payments instead of to NOI
      - This cap rate is called the *all risks yield*
  - *The discounted cash flow* method uses the present value of future cash flows, and an appropriate discount rate
    - NOI is projected for a specific holding period, as well as a terminal value at the end of the holding period
    - Terminal value can be estimated by capitalising future NOI at a future cap rate, which may be different from the initial cap rate
    - Net-operating income is the amount of income remaining after subtracting vacancy and collection losses, as well as operating expenses such as insurance, property taxes, utilities, maintenance, and repairs
  - *The sales comparison approach* uses sales prices of similar properties, that are adjusted for identifiable differences, such as size, age, location, condition, and the market at the time of sale

  ## Valuation With Different Lease Structures

  - The rent that is contracted for a given lease period will, over time, diverge from the current market rent
    - The contracted rent is then adjusted to the market upon lease renewal
    - The *term and revision approach* appraises the contract rent and the reversion upon renewal separately, using different cap rates
      - The reversion cap rate is derived from comparable, fully let properties
      - Because reversion is a future event it must be discounted to the present
      - The discount rate applied to the contract rent is usually lower than that for the reversion since the contracted rent is usually a below market value, entailing reduced liklihood of default
    - The *layer method* contract rent as one source of income (or layer) that is assumed to continue in perpetuity
      - The second layer is the increase in rent that occurs when the lease is renewed
      - A cap rate similar to the all risks yield is applied to the term rent since it is less risky, whilst a higher rate is applied to the incremental increases in income over time

  ## Financial Ratios in Real Estate Lending and Investing

  - Lenders often use the *debt service coverage ratio* and the *loan-to-value* ratio to determine the maximum loan amount for a given property
    - $\text{DSCR}=\frac{\text{NOI}_1}{\text{debt service}}$
    - $\text{LTV}=\frac{\text{loan amount}}{\text{appraised value}}$
  - If debt is used to finance a real-estate investment, equity investors may calculate the *equity dividend rate*, also known as the *cash-on-cash return* 
    - $\text{Equity dividend rate} = \frac{\text{CF}_1}{\text{equity}}$
