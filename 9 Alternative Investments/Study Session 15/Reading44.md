    - Main risks include changes in office vacancy and rental rates
  - Residential
    - Population growth and job creation primarily determine value
    - Usually features one year leases, and stable income
    - Risks include competition, inducements, the regional economy, and inflation of operating costs
  - Health care
    - Value is mostly affected by population growth, and the supply and demand of health care real estate

    - Main risks include demographics, goivernment funding, construction cycles, the financial condition of the providers operating within the properties, as well as tenant litigation
  - Industrial
    - Retail sales growth and population growth are the largest factors affecting value
    - Less cyclical than other real estate investments, featuring long leases, and slow change in incomes and values
    - Main risk includes shifts in the composition of local and national industrial bases and trade
  - Hotel

## Approaches to REIT valuation

- *Net asset value per share* is based on market valued, and is considered a fundamental measure of value
  - It is a measure of assets minus liabilities, using current market values
- *Relative value approaches* apply a multiple to a property's *funds from operations*
  - Funds from operations is an adjustment to reported earnings, adding back depreciation and deferred tax charges, and subtracting gains (losses) from sales and debt restructuring
  - *Adjusted funds from operations* also subtracts non-cash rent adjustments, and recurring maintenance-type capital expenditures and leasing commisions to give a more economically useful measure
  - FFO relies and fewer estimates and is more objective, but AFFO better accounts for the true cost of sustaining a property's income
- Discounted cash flow valuation is also used

## Differences Between REIT and REOC Investment

- REOCs are more reliant on capital appreciation to generate gains, since cash flows can be directly reinvested
- REITs tend to have higher current income
