# Reading 2: Standards of Professional Conduct

## Standard I: Professionalism

- *Knowledge of the law*
  - Laws, rules, regulations, and the Code and Standards of any relevant governing authority should be understood and complied with
  - Conflicts are resolved by adhering to the strictest set of requirements
  - Do not knowingly participate in violations, even partially
    - Dissociate from known violations as soon as possible, even if this requires resignation from one's position
  - Reporting of violations to CFAI is not required, but is encouraged
  - Compliance with fiduciary duties to clients is part of this standard
- *Independence and objectivity*
  - Professional activity should be exercised with independence and objectivity
  - Gifts, benefits, or compensation of any kind that could compromise the independence or objectivity of oneself, or of another investment professional, should not be either solicited, or accepted
    - This prohibition applies to all professional relationships, not merely those involving clients and prospects
  - Gifts from clients can be distinguished from gifts from third parties seeking to influence the conduct of an investment manager
    - Gifts from the former can be accepted, provided the appropriate disclosures are made
    - Acceptance of gifts from the latter would constitute a threat to independence and objective, and would therefore be a violate of the standard
- *Misrepresentation*
  - Facts regarding professional activities should not be knowingly misrepresented
  - When disseminating research, statistics provided by a recognised agency (such as Standard and Poor's) do not need to be cited
  - Work that is developed by an individual with a firm should be cited, but the specific individual need not be named; attributing the work to the relevant firm is sufficient
  - Making use of the research of other analysts without qualifying statements supplied with the original work is an example of misrepresentation that would constitute a violation of this standard
  - The provision of incomplete information, provided it was not done intentionally in order to mislead, is not a violation of this standard, even if inaccurate conclusions may result
  - If an anaylst or firm wants to use the work of others, they must sekk authorisation from the creator
  - Giving historical performance of a group of assets that has just been collected together to form a new fund, and implying that this return was generated by the firm is an example of misrepresentation
    - Selectively reporting the returns of assets only recently assembled together introduces a survivorship bias, since the current collation has been devised with the benefit of hindsight
- *Misconduct*
  - Conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceipt should not be engaged in
  - Activity reflecting poorly on one's integrity, reputation, trustworthiness, or competence should be avoided
  - Actions can still be considered violations of this standard, even if they do not relate to professional activities

## Standard II: Integrity of Capital Markets

- *Material non-public information*
  - Material non-public information should not be acted upon, nor should others be allowed or induced to do so
    - The means by which the information was gathered is irrelevant to the applicability of this standard
  - Activity intended to mislead market participants, through the creation of distorted prices or inflated traded volume should not be engaged in

## Standard III: Duties to Clients

- *Loyalty, prudence, and care*
  - Client interests should always come before the interests of oneself, or one's employer
  - Analysts should exercise care in determining to which parties fiduciary duties are owed
    - In some circumstances the individuals an analyst interacts with are not the beneficiaries of their work
      - E.g. fiduciary duties are owed to the paying members of a pension fund, not to the fund trustees

  - Clients should receive the benefit of one's loyalty, care, and prudent judgement
  - CFAI members are required to seek best price and execution with trades
    - *Directed brokerage* occurs when a client requests that a portion of the client's brokerage be used to purchase services that directly benefit the client
      - This may prevent best execution, but is not a violation of the standards, provided that the services purchased are used to benefit the client
      - Client brokerage should be used only for research products or services directly related to the investment decision-making process, not the management costs of the firm
    - If trades are directed through a broker in which the best price and execution may not be received, a written statement from clients indicating their awareness of this arrangement must be obtained
    - This standard does not require that all CFAI members exercise discretion on which trades to execute
      - Even if a member believes that the trade to be executed in inadvisable, CFAI members may be employed merely to provide the best execution of client orders, not to determine which orders to execute
  - Even if written permission from an employer has been given, a CFAI member may not begin independent practice without receiving the same permission from independent clients
  - It may not be in the interests of a client to vote in all proxies, but analysts are obligated to vote proxies in an informed and responsible manner
  - Fiduciary duty to clients obligates analysts to diversify investments, regardless of the quality of an investment considered on it's own merits
- *Fair dealing*
  - All clients should be dealt with fairly and objectively, in all professional activities
    - This requirement refers both to the provision of analysis, the divulging of developing opinions, as well as the dissemination of recommendations, and the execution of investment actions
  - Merely making clients aware of a priority of transactions that is unfair, or seeking consent from clients to imply it, does not prevent such an action of constituting a violating of the standard
  - When a change in recommendations has occurred, not executing trades until all clients have been informed sounds fair, but it violates the firm's fiduciary duty to those clients who are reachable in time
  - Pro-rata allocations of shares on the basis of advance indication of interest is a method of allocation that is deemed to be compliant with the standards
  - Differential treatment of accounts that are performance-fee based, and those that are not, is an example of allocating trades based on compensation arrangements, which is not permissible
  - It is permissible to deviate from a pro-rata basis as long as the process used instead is inherently fair
- *Suitability*
  - Reasonable enquiries should be made into a client's investment experience, objectives, constraints, and both capacity and willingness to accept risk
    - The results of these enquiries should be used to formulate a mandated investment style that is suitable for the client, and this should be adhered to
  - This information should be reassessed and updated regularly
  - Recommendations should be made in the context of what is suitable for a given client
  - The divulging of investment opinions should be done carefully, and not before suitability has been assessed
  - Suitability of an individual investment should be evaluated within the context of a portfolio
  - If clients request a change to their allocations, a review of the IPS should be performed to confirm that the change is suitable
  - If a change of circumstances is anticipated, the existing IPS should continue to be honoured until changes to the IPS have been discussed in full and agreed with the client
- *Performance presentation*
  - Performance presentation should be fair, accurate, and complete
  - Disclosures around the source and nature of data used is recommended to prevent giving misleading impressions of investment performance that can be achieved
- *Preservation of confidentiality*
  - Information relating to clients, both current and former, should be kept confidential
  - Exceptions include:
    - Information relating to illegal activity
    - Legally mandated disclosures
    - Disclosure that is permitted by the client
  - Any and all information pertaining to a client is protected under this standard, not merely information relating to investment activities

## Standard IV: Duties to Employers

- *Loyalty*
  - The interests of one's employer should come before one's own, who should not be deprived of the benefit of one's skills or abilities
  - Divulging confidential information, or otherwise harming one's employer, is also prohibited by this standard
  - Disseminating investment recommendations in a personal capacity before allowing one's employer to benefit from that recommendation is an example of depriving one's employer of the benefit of one's ability and skill, and represents a violation of the standard
  - If undertaking independent practice whilst employed, and CFAI member should notify their employer of the services to be offered, the expected compensation, and the expected duration
    - Written permission from one's employer must be given if the independent work may represent competition with one's employer
  - It should be noted that this standard does not require that employer interests supersede all others, but only in matters related to one's employment
    - For example, important personal or family obligations should not necessarily be ignored at all times
  - Material developed for an employer is owned by the employer
- *Additional compensation arrangements*
  - Compensation that may result in a conflict of interest with one's employer should not be accepted, unless written consent is obtained from all parties
  - This standard does not require that any gift received by a CFAI member merits disclosure
    - This is particularly the case for longstanding arrangements existing before professional relationships
- *Responsibilities of supervisors*
  - Reasonable efforts must be made to ensure that anyone under the supervision or authority of one's employer complies with all relevant requirements, as well as the Code and Standards
  - This standard applies particularly to the establishing of reasonable compliance procedures within a place of employment
  - Informing one's employer of one's responsibility to adhere to the Code and Standards is a recommendation, not a requirement
  - Supervisors must be held accountable for the actions of those they supervise with respect to compliance both with laws and regulations, as well as company policies and procedures
  - Authority to enforce and implement compliance procedures should rest with the compliance officer, rather than vested in someone else

## Standard V: Investment Analysis, Recommendations and Actions

- *Diligence and Reasonable Basis*
  - Taking investment actions, investment analysis, and making investment recommendations, should all be completed with diligence, independence, and thoroughness
  - All these actions should have a reasonable and adequate basis, supported by investigation and research
  - Decisions regarding the employment of advisors to assist in taking investment actions is also covered by this standard
    - Making this choice on cost alone, without consideration of quality and appropriateness would be a violation of the standard
- *Communication With Clients and Prospects*
  - The basic format and principles of the investment process used to analyse and select securities, as well as to construct and value portfolios should be disclosed to clients
  - Any changes should also be disclosed promptly
  - Identifying factors that are of importance, and relevant to professional activities should be done with reasonable judgement, and factors identified should be communicated to clients and prospects
    - The use of the phrase 'reasonable judgement' allows some discretion in omitting information that would not be material, or may no longer be relevant
  - Opinions and facts should always be clearly differentiated
  - Even if opinions are clearly based on an analysts own conclusions rather than established as fact, communications may still violate the standard if there is a lack of sufficient detail in the evaluation process, particularly if it is a complicated one
  - This standard covers communication of all types
  - Adequate disclosure of investment policy is typically achieved by clearly stating the policy in the firm's prospectus
- *Record retention*
  - Any records pertaining to analysis, recommendations, actions, and any other investment-related communications with clients and prospects should be retained and preserved
  - In the absence of specific guidance, records should be retained for at least seven years

## Standard VI: Conflicts of Interest

- *Disclosure of conflicts*
  - Anything that may impair one's independence or objectivity, or interfere with duties to employers, clients, or prospects, should be disclosed fully and fairly
  - Disclosures should be prominent, expressed plainly, and communicate effectively
  - In some cases, disclosure may be insufficient to eliminate the threat posed by a conflict of interest, and hiring a full discretionary power, or making use of a blind trust may be necessary
  - A firms role as a market maker for a security, or a CFAI member's role as a director of a recommended company are examples of conflicts where disclosure is required
  - Disclosure of compensation arrangements are particularly important where they may influence an analyst's choice of security
- *Priority of transactions*
  - Transactions for clients and employers must take precedence over transaction made for one's own benefit
- *Referral fees*
  - Any compensation, consideration, or benefit received by, or paid to, others for recommendations of products or services must be disclosed to employers, clients, and prospects

## Standard VII: Responsibilities as a CFAI Member or CFA Candidate

- *Conduct as participants in CFAI programs*
  - Conduct that compromises the reputation or integrity of the CFAI, the CFA designation, or any CFAI program, must not be engaged in
  - This standard is not intended to prevent the expression of opinions or beliefs regarding the CFAI
  - Discussion of questions (or even broad subject areas) that appear on exams is prohibited by this standard
- *Reference to the CFAI, the CFA designation, and the CFA program*
  - The meaning or implications of membership of the CFAI, of holding the CFA designation, or of candidacy in the CFA program, must not be misrepresented or exagerrated
  - This standard prohibits any reference to 'partial' designations
  - The CFA designation should always be used as an adjective, never as a noun
  - Additionally, the CFA designation should always be presented without periods
  - "Chartered Financial Analyst" and "CFA" are both valid presentations after a charterholder's name
