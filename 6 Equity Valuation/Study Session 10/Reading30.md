# Reading 30: Discounted Dividend Valuation

## DCF Methods

- DCF valuation is based on the idea that the value today of any security is the discounted value of all future cash flows
  - *Dividend discount models* define cash flow as dividends to be received in the future
    - The primary advantage of a dividend discount model is that it is theoretically justified
    - A DDM is most appropriate for mature, profitable firms that are not growing quickly, or for large diversified indices
    - The DDM can be used if the firm in question:
      - Has a dividend history
      - Has a consistent dividend policy related to earnings
      - Is being valued from the perspective of a minority shareholder
    - If the dividend growth rate is too high, it should be replaced by a growth rate closer to that of GDP
      - This is because a firm cannot, in the long run, grow at a rate significantly greater than the growth rate of the economy in which it operates
  - *Free cash flow models* define cash flow from a security as free cash flow
    - There are two versions  of FCF valuation:
      - Free cash flow to the firm
        - This is the cash flow generated by the firm above that required to maintain operations
      - Free cash flow to equity
        - This is free cash flow to the firm minus debt service and any preferred dividends
    - FCF valuation is appropriate when the firm:
      - Does not have a stable dividend policy
      - Does not pay dividends according to earnings
      - Has an FCF related to profitability
      - Is being valued from the perspective of a controlling shareholder
  - *Residual income* is the earnings collected during the period that exceed an investor's required earnings (or *economic profit*)
    - Using this method of valuation, the value of equity is the firm's book value plus the present value of future residual income
    - The method requires an in-depth analysis of the firm's accounting accruals
    - The RI method should be used when the firm being valued:
      - Does not have a dividend history
      - Has negative FCF
      - Has transparent and high quality accounting
- Every method requires forecasting future cash flows, determining an appropriate discount rate, and then discounting those cash flows to calculate value
  - When using the FCFF method, the appropriate discount rate is the WACC
  - For any other method, the correct discount rate is the cost of equity
- Limitations of the dividend discount model include:
  - Some of the assumptions required are impractical
  - The model lacks the ability to be flexible according to real world values

## Gordon Growth Model

- The *Gordon growth model* assumes dividends will grow at a constant rate $g$
$$
V_0 = \frac{D_1}{r_\text{equity} - g}
$$
- A related formulation uses a concept called the *present value of growth opportunities*, stating that firm value is comprised of it's current 'non-growth' value, plus value derived from growth opportunities
$$
V_0 = \frac{E_1}{r_\text{equity}} + \text{PVGO}
$$
- Limitations of the Gordon growth model include the following:
  - Valuation is very sensitive to the values for $r$ and $g$
  - The payment of dividends either now or in the foreseeable future is assumed
  - Unpredictable growth patterns can make employing the model a complex process

## Two-Stage Growth Model

- Multistage models assume that the firm temporarily grows at one rate before a period, before growing constantly at another rate
  - The model is mainly used to model temporary high growth, followed by lower, permanent growth
$$
V_0 = \sum^T_{t=1}\left(\frac{D_0 \cdot (1 + g_\text{initial})^t}{(1 + r)^t}\right) + \frac{D_T \cdot (1 + g_\text{final})}{(1 + r)^T \cdot (r - g_\text{final})}
$$
- The first component is a sum of each dividend payment, having grown at the initial high growth rate, discounted to $t=0$
- The second component is the terminal value of future dividend payments, given by taking the final dividend payment in the high growth period and appreciating it by the lower steady state growth rate, dividing by $r - g_\text{final}$ , and then also discounting to $t = 0$
  - It should be noted that this second component takes the form of the Gordon growth model, with the result discounted back to the present day
  - If the future expected share price is known, then it can be substituted in place of this component, and discounted to the present day along with dividends in the intervening time interval
- The model is generalisable to handle any number of intervening periods
  - A three-stage model might be used to analyse a profitable high-tech firm, since they grow at very high rates, and can be expected to maintain those rates for some time
  - After this initial stage, a period of decline, and then long-run growth should also be modelled

## H-Model

- The H-Model is also a two-stage model, that improves on the two-stage growth model by allowing the initial high growth rate to linearly and smoothly change to the second rate, instead of an instantaneous shift
$$
V_0 = \frac{D_0 \cdot (1 + g_\text{final})}{r - g_\text{final}} + \frac{D_0 \cdot \frac{t}{2} \cdot (g_\text{initial} - g_\text{final})}{r - g_\text{final}}
$$
- The first term in this formulation is the value if there were no period of higher growth
- The second term is the additional value resulting from the higher growth period

## Solving For Required Return

- Any of these models can be rearranged to give values for required return (provided the other variables are known)
  - The algebra for multi-stage models can become very complex
  - The Gordon growth model is, however, simple to apply
$$
r_\text{equity} = \frac{D_1}{P_0} + g
$$

## The Sustainable Growth Rate

- The *sustainable growth rate* SGR is the rate that earnings (or dividends) can grow indefinitely 
  - Given a fixed capital structure 
  - With no further equity issuance
- SGR can be determined using a rearranged and simplified DuPont formula:
$$
\begin{aligned}
g& = \left(\frac{\text{net income} - \text{dividends}}{\text{equity}} \right) = \text{ROE} - \left(\frac{\text{dividends}}{\text{equity}} \right) 
\end{aligned}
$$
