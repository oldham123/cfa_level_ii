# Reading 29: Industry and Company Analysis

## Forecasting Revenues

- *Bottom-up analysis* starts at the level of an individual firm, or of individual firm segments
- *Top-down analysis* begins with macroeconomic expectations
- *Hybrid analysis* incorporates features of both approaches
- The *growth relative to GDP growth* approach involves estimating the relationship between GDP and sales
  - Then sales growth is forecast based on a GDP growth forecast
- The *market growth and market share approach* begins with an industry sales estimate
  - Firm sales are then forecast as a percentage of industry sales using a forecast of industry growth

## Forecasting Expenses

- COGS is often modelled as a percentage of estimated future revenue
  - Expected changes in input prices can improve COGS estimates
  - R&D and corporate overhead are likely to be stable, whilst selling and distribution costs increase with sales
- If *economies of scale* are present, costs should fall (per unit produced), and operating margins should rise, as production volume increases
- Input costs and COGS will be positively correlated unless a firm has hedged the risk of input price increases
  - Vertically integrated firms are less likely to be affected by input price rises
  - The effect of increasing prices to account for COGS increases on sales depends on:
    - The price elasticity of demand for the products in question
    - The timing and amount of competitor price increases
- Technology advances decrease production costs, increasing profit margins (for early adopters)
  - In other cases advances may lead to better substitutes, or brand new products
  - Analysts can estimate a *cannibalisation factor* to account for the effect of a new product on sales of existing products
- Gross interest expense is primarily determined by the amount of debt outstanding, and interest rates
  - Net interest expense is gross interest expense minus interest income on cash and short term securities owned

## Forecasting Balance Sheet Items

- Some balance sheet items can be estimated based on historical relationships with income statement items
  - Forecasts for items such as revenue can also be used to generate forecasts for balance sheet items
- PP&E forecasts can be improved by analysing capital expenditures for maintenance and for growth separately

## Return on Invested Capital

- Forecasts of greater ROIC (relative to peers) can be the result of a competitive advantage of some kind, or inappropriate financial data having been used to produce the forecast

## Estimating Long-Term Growth

- Terminal value estimates are sensitive to estimates of long-term growth, making long-term growth forecasting important to generating many other kinds of analysis
  - Analysts should be on the lookout for *inflection points*: points in time where the growth trajectory is expected to change significantly
