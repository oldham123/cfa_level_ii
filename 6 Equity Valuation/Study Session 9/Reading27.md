# Reading 27: Equity Valuation - Applications and Processes

## Definitions of Value
- *Intrinsic value* is the asset value estimate made by a hypothetical investor with complete information
  - Market prices may diverge from intrinsic value, since markets are not perfectly efficient
  - The difference between an estimate of intrinsic value and of market price has two components:
    - The market's error in correctly pricing the asset
    - The analyst's error in estimating the true intrinsic value
$$
\text{IV}_\text{analyst} - \text{price} = (\text{IV}_\text{actual} - \text{price}) + (\text{IV}_\text{analyst} - \text{IV}_\text{actual})
$$
- The *going concern* assumption is the assumption that a company will continue to operate
- *Liquidation value* is the value of a firm's assets if sold separately (net of liabilities to be settled)
  - Liquidation value will often be less than other definitions, due to, for example the firm's ability to generate future profits being neglected in the calculation
    - However, in the case of unprofitable firms, liquidation may be the best option, and in these cases liquidation value will be greater than the going-concern value
- *Equity valuation* is the estimation of asset value using either:
  - A model consuming variables believed to determine the asset's fundamental value as inputs
  - Comparison to the observable market values of 'similar' assets

## Industry  Structure
- The *five elements of industry structure* describing the competitive environment of an industry are:
  - Threat of new entrants
  - Threat of substitutes
  - Bargaining power of buyers
  - Bargaining power of suppliers 
  - Rivalry among existing competitors

## Firm Valuation
- *Quality of earnings* issues can be broken down into several categories:
  - Aggressive income recognition
  - Reclassification of gains and non-operating income 
  - Expense recognition and losses
  - Amortisation, depreciation, and discount rates
  - Off-balance sheet items
- *Absolute valuation* models refer to models estimating intrinsic value based on future earnings, cash flows, and risk
  - Dividend discount models, and free cash flow models are examples
  - Absolute valuation is often preferable for closely held firms, since relative valuation methods require good availability of data to drive them
- *Relative valuation* models estimate value relative to market prices of similar securities

## The Valuation Process

- The valuation process as described by Pinto, Henry, Robinson, and Stowe has five steps
  1. Understanding the business
  2. Forecasting company performance
  3. Selecting a valuation model
  4. Complete a valuation
  5. Decision making
