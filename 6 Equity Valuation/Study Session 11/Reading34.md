# Reading 34: Private Company Valuation

## Private Firms

- Private firms are firms which are not publicly traded
- Valuation is based on similar factors as for other companies, such as:
  - Stage of lifecycle
  - Firm size
  - Influence of short term investors
  - Quality of management
  - Management/shareholder overlap
  - Quality of reporting
  - Tax implications
- Private firm stock is more illiquid and has less marketability than public stock
    - Equity ownership is also typically more concentrated

## Reasons to Value Total Capital of a Private Company

- Reasons for valuing private firms include:
  - Transaction-related valuations are necessitated by financing or purchase of a firm
    - Venture capital financing
    - IPOs
    - Acquisition
    - Bankruptcy proceedings
    - Performance-based managerial compensation
  - Compliance-related valuations are performed for legal or regulatory reasons
    - Financial reporting
    - Tax compliance
  - Litigation-related valuations may be required for:
    - Shareholder suits
    - Damage claims
    - Lost profits claims
    - Divorce settlements
- The appropriate valuation technique is determined by the relevant definition of value:
  - Fair market value
  - Fair value for financial reporting
  - Fair value for litigation
  - Market value
  - Investment value
  - Intrinsic value

## Approaches to Private Firm Valuation

- The *income approach* values a firm as the present value of expected future income
  - FCFF is usually preferred to FCFE in private firm valuation, particularly if a change in capital structure is likely
    - This is due to the WACC being less sensitive to a change in leverage than the cost of equity
- The *market approach* values a firm using price multiples, themselves based on the sales of comparable assets
- The *asset-based approach* values a firm by subtracting firm liabilities from firm assets
  - This approach is useful when future cash flows are very uncertain, for example, early in a firm's life
  - It is typically not used for firms where the going-concern assumption is valid, since there are components of firm value which it fails to account for
- The *excess earnings method*  begins with an estimate of earnings that should result from working capital and fixed assets based on required return
  - The value of intangible assets can be estimated as the present value of the future stream of earnings in excess of these anticipated earnings
  - This method is useful for small firms with significant intangible assets

## Estimating Normalised Earnings

- *Normalised earnings* exclude nonrecurring and unusual items
  - An analyst valuing a private firm may encounter:
    - Discretionary spending
    - Tax-motivated expenses
    - Excessive compensation
    - Payment of personal expenses using firm funds
  - Each of these items calls for adjustment when attempting to value the firm
  - Furthermore, company-owned real estate may also require adjustment
    - This entails removing revenues and expenses from real estate used in the company's operations
    - The value of the real estate is then added to the income-based value of the firm as if owned real estate is all a non-operating asset of the firm
      - This adjustment can be significant for small firms, and prevents owned real-estate from obscuring the true value of the firm

## Strategic and Nonstrategic Buyers

- A strategic transaction is one that considers perceived synergies of assets that the acquirer already holds
  - These synergies would allow the acquirer to derive extra value from the purchase, thus meriting a higher purchase price
- A non-strategic (or financial) transaction assumes no synergies, such as when one firm buys another in a dissimilar industry

## Discount Rate Estimation

- *Size premiums* are often added to discount rates for small private companies
  - Estimating this premium using small public firms may bias the rate upwards, since many small firms in the sample may be experiencing financial distress
- *Availability and cost of debt* is an important consideration, since a private firm may have less access to debt financing than a public firm
  - Equity capital is usually more expensive than debt
  - Private firms also typically have a higher level of operating risk, leading to a higher WACC
- Some acquirers may (incorrectly) use their own cost of capital when valuing an acquisition, instead of that of the target firm
  - This results in an inflated firm valuation
- The lower availability of information for private firms leads to *projection risk*
  - This means forecasts are less reliable, and necessitates using a higher discount rate
- Estimating the appropriate discount rate for a private firm in an early stage of its lifecycle is difficult
  - If a firm has high levels of unsystematic risk, then the use of the CAPM may be inappropriate
  - Whilst discount rate ranges can be specified for each stage of the lifecycle, it is not a trivial task to determine which stage of the lifecycle a firm is in

## CAPM Limitations

- Use of the CAPM, or its derivatives for a private firm is not as easy as for public firms
  - Beta is usually estimated using public data
    - This may be inappropriate for private firms with little chance of going public, or of acquisition
    - Courts in the U.S. have in fact rejected the use of CAPM models for private firms
    - The build-up method can be used, by assuming implicitly that beta is one
- The expanded CAPM may be used instead, adding a size premium, as well as a company-specific risk premium

## Market Approaches to Valuation

- The * guideline public company method* uses the market values of similar public firms
  - These values are then adjusted for differences in growth and risk
- The *guideline transactions method* uses values from actual sales of controlling positions in either public or private companies
- The *prior transaction method* uses prices from actual prices of the private firm's shares in the past

## Control and Marketability

- A controlling position is held to be more valuable than a minority position
  - It gives the owner the ability to determine company strategy
- More marketable shares are more valuable than otherwise identical shares with less marketability
  - Buying shares with low liquidity may entail being forced to settle for a less than optimal price when selling later on
- When using data from the market or previous transactions, adjustments must be made for differences in both control and marketability
  - Private shares should be discounted to compensate investors for their lack of marketability
    - The size of the marketability discount can be estimated using the difference between the sales price of traded shares and restricted shares of the same company
    - Another method compares sales prices pre and post-IPO
  - If the private shares being valued entail a different level of control than that of the public shares being used for valuation, then a premium or discount should be applied
- Minority shareholders may seek their own valuations or opinions of firm performance, in order to safeguard their interests against controlling shareholders
  - These opinions are referred to as *fairness opinions*
